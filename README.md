Classifying Medical Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Achieved 90% accuracy in image classification
Abstract:
In this paper, we investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to categorise the Medical MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale photos of medical diseases. CNNs have achieved exceptional success in image classification problems because of their capacity to automatically learn significant features from raw pixel data. Our approach entails preparing the Medical MNIST images to make them more suitable for CNN-based classification. We next build and train a CNN architecture adapted to the dataset's characteristics, using techniques like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract and incorporate hierarchical features. We evaluate our CNN model's ability to appropriately categorise medical images into their relevant groups through thorough experimentation and review. Furthermore, we compare our findings to existing approaches to determine the efficacy and efficiency of our strategy. The findings of this study contribute to the advancement of computer-aided diagnosis systems by providing insights into CNNs' potential for automated medical image processing jobs. This study emphasises the importance of deep learning techniques in healthcare applications and pave the way for future advances in medical image processing and analysis.

Introduction:
Medical imaging is one area where the advent of fast-growing AI and deep learning methods has caused a sea change in medical diagnoses. There is an urgent need to create reliable algorithms that can read and categorise medical photographs due to the ever-increasing amount of digitalized medical data. With their remarkable performance in picture identification tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become an important technology in this domain.

The Medical MNIST dataset is used as a standardised benchmark to evaluate algorithms for medical image processing. The dataset, which contains grayscale photos representing ten distinct types of medical illnesses such as pneumonia, melanoma, and bone fractures, among others, presents a daunting task for classification algorithms due to its broad and subtle content.

Faria, D. R. (2018) It discusses various state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, pre-trained models, and popular datasets with large volumes of data. The paper emphasizes the impact of data set size, number of epochs, and GPU-based systems on image classification accuracy. The authors also compare the performance of different neural network models and analyze the influence of factors such as image category and training data size on accuracy.

In this study, we seek to use CNNs to categorise Medical MNIST photos with high accuracy and efficiency. CNNs are ideal for this task because of their intrinsic capacity to automatically extract relevant information from images using hierarchical layers of convolutional and pooling processes. CNNs may detect detailed patterns and subtle variations associated with specific medical disorders by learning from a large number of labelled samples.

Our research includes numerous crucial components. First, we preprocess the Medical MNIST photos to improve their quality and allow for more efficient feature extraction. Next, we develop and execute a CNN architecture that is suited to the dataset's specific properties. This design consists of numerous layers of convolutions, activations, pooling, and fully connected layers, resulting in a comprehensive model capable of recognising subtle patterns in medical images.

Through comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, we hope to demonstrate the usefulness and resilience of our CNN-based technique for reliably categorising Medical MNIST photos. Additionally, we hope to share insights into the possible applications of such technology in real-world medical circumstances, where timely and correct diagnosis can have a considerable impact on patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.

Aim:

CNNs classify the Medical MNIST dataset in this study, automating medical picture analysis. Our goal is to use CNNs to learn precise patterns and features from image data to construct a classification model that can distinguish pathological scenarios in the dataset. CNNs can improve medical image processing, diagnostic accuracy, treatment decisions, and patient care, according to this study.
